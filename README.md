Operating Overloading in Athletic Heights Analysis

Introduction:
This project aimed to analyze the height distributions of athletes across four college sports teams: men's and women's swimming and volleyball. The central goal was to compare average heights and identify outliers in both directions.

Techniques Used:
We utilized web scraping with BeautifulSoup to collect player rosters from various college websites, followed by pandas for data organization, and matplotlib for visualization. SQLite was used for persistent storage.

Methodology:
Names and heights were extracted from HTML tables. Heights were converted to inches for accurate comparison. Tallest and shortest athletes were identified using max/min filters, with ties fully included.

Presenting the Findings:
The average heights for each category are:
- Women's Swimming: 65.5 in
- Men's Volleyball: 73.12 in
- Women's Volleyball: 65.5 in
- Men's Swimming: 71.5 in

Discussion:
The findings align with general expectations: volleyball players, particularly men, tend to be taller than swimmers. However, due to sample limitations, this may not fully represent broader trends across all collegiate programs.

Conclusion:
Through operating overloading in data collection and processing, we successfully gathered and evaluated athlete height data across multiple sports categories.
